#example: generate an ssh key for ansible : 
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "Ansible SSH Key"
#if you're asked for the location to save the key : enter the location eg /home/thecarver/.ssh/ansible
#skip the passpharase for the ansible key

#copy the key to each of the servers
ssh-copy-id -i ./ssh/ansible.pub 172.16.250.133 

#try to ssh into the serve using the key
ssh -i ~/./ssh/ansible 172.16.250.133 

#git-bash git ssh setup
ssh-keygen -t rsa
#//Generating public/private rsa key pair.
